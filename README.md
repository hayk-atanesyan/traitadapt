# TraitAdapt (traitadapt)

This is a quick and dirty example of basic decision making system based on previous data, mostly for npas in games.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose is to show that an adaptable and reasonably sensible decision making in games can be done with almost no performance cost, without need for machine learning and laughably simply. Everything is hardcoded, but the guts should be provided in external scripts in a real project, for obvious reasons.
